				<h3> <br> Syracuse University has an affluent greek life presence with over twenty greek houses surrounding the college. <br> A select number of members are permitted to live in the greek life residence throughout the school year. Whereas other members visit the houses for events, chapter meetings and friendly get togethers. Students' involvement in greek life definitely shapes their daily routines but how does greek life impact parking violations? </h3>

				<h3> <br> After analyzing the data on Syracuse, New York parking violations in the past year, an increase in ticketing around the following addresses was found. </h3>
			<div id= "assign_text2">
				<h3> <br> - 1210 Harrison Street <br> - 304 Walnut Place <br> - 306 Walnut Place <br> - 703 Walnut Ave <br> - 803 Walnut Ave <br> - 901 Walnut Ave <br> - 743 Comstock Ave </h3>

				<p> <br> Olivia Gambino, member and Vice President of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion of Syracuse’s Alpha Phi explains how although she lives in her sorority house, parking is not provided. Yet, she occasionally needs to have her vehicle nearby leading her to park her car on the street in front of her house. Gambino states, “I’ve accumulated a decent amount of parking violations in the past year, I believe I have six right now. I owe like $300 worth of parking fees and I received all of them after parking in front of the greek life houses on walnut”. Gambino further explained that she overuses her parking meter time due to the congestion around the houses and limited parking options.</p>

				
				<p> <em> However, this data is from an entire year. So, what happens around the houses when students go home for summer break? </em> </p>

			<div>	
				<p> change later: When looking at the data without the summer months, it is seen that the amount of parking tickets is nearly split. Illustrating that the amount of students on campus does not necessarily have an impact on the amount of parking violations made when near greek life houses. </p>
